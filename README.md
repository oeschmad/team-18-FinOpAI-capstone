<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
### About The Project

Many young, inexperienced investors struggle with structuring their portfolios due to overwhelming 
information and market volatility. Traditional investment strategies, such as 60/40 allocation or 
passive index investing, fail to adapt to changing market conditions and user-specific risk profiles. <br />
This project develops an AI-driven portfolio optimization system leveraging reinforcement learning 
(RL) to dynamically allocate investments across stocks, bonds, cryptocurrencies, and commodities. 
The approach integrates financial market data, economic indicators, and user risk profiles to provide 
personalized investment strategies.

The system aims to: <br />
* Classify investors based on risk tolerance using machine learning. <br />
* Predict asset returns with deep learning models. <br />
* Optimize portfolio allocation using an RL-based model. <br />
* Provide an interactive dashboard for investment insights.<br />
